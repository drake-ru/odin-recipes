        <h3>Description</h3>
        <h4>Disclaimer: <em>none of the pictures used on my web pages are mine.</em></h4>
        <p>Really simple little mug cake you can make in the microwave, adapted from a recipe I found online a long time ago.</p>
        <p>All the ingredients needed will likely be found in your baking cupboard, and you can add extras to embellish as you please!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2tbsp plain flour</li>
            <li>1tbsp maple syrup</li>
            <li>2tbsp plant milk</li>
            <li>1/4tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>2tbsp smooth peanut butter</li>
            <li>1tsp vanilla extract (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Take a medium-sized, microwave-safe mug and tap in the flour and baking powder. Mix together well.</li>
            <li>Add the maple syrup and plant milk and stir together well until there are no clumps.</li>
            <li>Add the vanilla extract at this point, then add the peanut butter and stir together really well. The ideal consistency is a stodgy one. If it is too watery, add some more peanut butter or flour until it reaches your desired consistency.</li>
            <li>Microwave on high for 60 seconds or thereabouts.</li>
            <li>Check it is cooked enough (should be a cakey consistency, hence the name). Then dig in and eeeeeeeenjoy!</li>
        </ol>
