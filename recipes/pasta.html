        <h3>Description</h3>
        <h4>Disclaimer: <em>none of the pictures used on my web pages are mine.</em></h4>
        <p>This is a very simple pasta recipe and a staple of mine - it is incredibly adaptable and uses ingredients that everyone will have hanging about in their kitchen cupboards.</p>
        <p>The ingredients listed can be subbed out for similar ones, however the base for this is dry pasta and a tomato sauce. Quantities will be listed for a single portion, however they can scale up easily (as long as you have an appropriately-sized cooking pot for that).</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>75g dry pasta</li>
            <li>125ml passata or half a tin of chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li>3 chesnut mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 spring onion</li>
            <li>handful cherry tomatoes</li>
            <li>marinaded beetroot (optional)</li>
            <li>firm tofu (optional)</li>
            <li>nutritional yeast (optional)</li>
            <li>fresh rocket (optional)</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a medium-sized pot 3/4 full with freshly boiled water from the kettle and put it on a medium heat on the hob.</li>
            <li>Once the water is bubbling, throw in the dry pasta. Allow it to simmer (not aggressively boiling) for 8-10 mins, depending on how al dente you want your pasta.</li>
            <li><p>Whilst the pasta is cooking, prepare your ingredients:</p>
            <p>Chop the mushrooms, spring onion, cherry tomatoes and any other ingredients that can be chopped e.g. tofu and beetroot.</p></li>
            <li>Once the pasta has finished cooking, turn off the heat and drain the water. Return the pot to the lowest possible heat and add the passata/chopped tomatoes. Allow to simmer for 30s and then add the mushrooms (if you find them taking a long time to wilt, put a lid on top to cover so they steam faster, otherwise, if you're not bothered by lightly cooked mushrooms, don't bother).</li>
            <li>Add the remaining ingredients and stir well to coat in the sauce.</li>
            <li>Serve up and top with nutritional yeast, rocket and salt and pepper to taste, if so desired.</li>
        </ol>
